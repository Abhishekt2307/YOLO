# YOLO architecture ans related functions
Here we have basic architechture implementation of YOLO version 1  and also algorithms are implemented using pytorch .There are described in the papers that are officially published.These algorithms are intersection over union(IOU) ,non max suppression which makes use of IOU ans mAP as well as loss function is implemented.
